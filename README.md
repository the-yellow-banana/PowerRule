# PowerRule
This file is mainly for finding the terms of a derivative using the power rule only. So only adding terms will work.
Also, you can only use the variable x 
I know the code is very messey, it is my first code :D improve it if you would like!

IMPORTANT: ONLY POLYNOMIALS WILL WORK! NO FANCY STUFF LIKE LOGS OR DIVISION OR MULTIPLYING FUNCITONS. JUST ADDING TERMS AND ADDING NEGATIVE TERMS.


EX:
4x
4x^3+32x^2
43x^2+-32x+3

WILL NOT WORK:

ln(3x)
3x/3x^2
